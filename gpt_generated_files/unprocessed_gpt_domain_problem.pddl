        (jumped robot1)
        (taken_thing thing1)
    )
)
)
```

In this problem, we have a robot named "robot1", a person named "person1", two locations named "location1" and "location2", a thing named "thing1", and a bomb named "bomb1". The initial state specifies that the robot, person, thing, and bomb are in their respective locations. The goal state specifies that the robot should move to location2, talk to person1 at location1, shout, jump, and have the thing1 taken.

Please note that the problem file includes only the problem definition without any comments or additional information. You can modify the initial and goal states as well as the objects to match your specific scenario.
