Apologies for the confusion. Here is the PDDL problem file based on the provided domain and set of actions:

```pddl
(define (problem system_problem)
  (:domain system_domain)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    location1 - location
    location2 - location
    person1 - person
    coffee_machine - thing
  )
  (:init
    (at robot1 location1)
    (at person1 location1)
    (at coffee_machine location2)
  )
  (:goal
    (taken_thing coffee_machine)
  )
)
```

This problem file is named `system_problem.pddl` and uses the `system_domain` domain. It defines objects including the robot (`robot1`), locations (`location1` and `location2`), a person (`person1`), and the coffee machine (`coffee_machine`). The initial state specifies the locations of the robot, person, and coffee machine, while the goal state is for the coffee machine to be taken.

Please note that this problem file does not include any comments and follows the correct syntax for PDDL 1.2.
