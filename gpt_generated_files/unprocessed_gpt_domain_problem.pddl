Certainly! Here is the PDDL problem file based on the provided domain file and the set of actions that the system can perform:

```PDDL
; Problem definition for the system_problem

(define (problem system_problem)
  (:domain system_domain)

  ; Objects
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    location1 location2 - location
    person1 - person
    coffee - thing
  )

  ; Initial state
  (:init
    (at robot1 location1)
    (at person1 location1)
    (at coffee location2)
  )

  ; Goal state
  (:goal
    (taken_thing coffee)
  )
)
```

Please note that I have included a simple initial state and goal state for demonstration purposes. You can modify them as per your requirements.
